## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?

**Check build logs:**

2. Read the error message
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies: Run `npm install` locally first
   - TypeScript errors: Run `npm run build` locally to test
   - Node version: Vercel uses Node 18+ by default

### App Not Working After Deploy?

**Check browser console:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for errors
3. Common issues:
   - Service Worker not registering: Clear cache and reload
   - 404 errors: Check `vercel.json` file exists

### Notifications Not Working?

- Service Worker needs HTTPS (Vercel provides this)
