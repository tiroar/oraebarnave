# 📱 Notification Guide - Samsung S22 Ultra & Android

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: PWA Notification Limitations**

This app is a **PWA (Progressive Web App)** which has limitations on background notifications. Here's what you need to know:

---

## 🔴 **The Problem**

**PWAs cannot run true background tasks like native apps.**

When you close the app or lock your phone:
- ❌ JavaScript stops running
- ❌ Scheduled notifications (setTimeout) are cleared
- ❌ No notifications will trigger

This is a **fundamental browser limitation**, not an app bug.

---

## ✅ **Solutions for Samsung S22 Ultra**

### **Option 1: Keep App Running in Background** (Best for PWA)

1. **Install as PWA:**
   - Open https://oraebarnave.vercel.app/ in Chrome
   - Tap menu → "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen"
   - App icon appears on home screen

2. **Open the PWA** from home screen icon (not from Chrome)

3. **Enable Background Activity:**
   - Settings → Apps → Ora e Barnave
   - Battery → **Allow background activity**
   - Battery → **Unrestricted** (not Optimized)

4. **Keep App in Recent Apps:**
   - Press home button (don't swipe away app)
   - App stays in background
   - Notifications work while app is in memory

5. **Disable Battery Optimization:**
   - Settings → Battery → Background usage limits
   - **Turn OFF** "Put unused apps to sleep"
   - Add Ora e Barnave to exceptions

**Limitations:**
- May still stop if phone needs memory
- Battery drain (minimal)
- Not 100% reliable

---

### **Option 2: Use Chrome Notifications** (Partial Solution)

Samsung Internet and Chrome support **Periodic Background Sync** but with limitations:

**What it does:**
- Checks periodically (every 15-30 minutes) if app is installed
- Shows reminder to open app

**What it doesn't do:**
- ❌ Exact-time notifications
- ❌ Works only on Chrome Android (not Samsung Internet)
- ❌ Requires specific battery settings

**How to enable:**
1. Use **Chrome browser** (not Samsung Internet)
2. Install PWA from Chrome
3. Keep Chrome running in background
4. Allow Chrome background activity

### **Option 3: Native Android App** ✅ RECOMMENDED

For **reliable, exact-time notifications**, use the native Android version:

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Works with phone locked
- ✅ No battery optimization issues

**How to get it:**

## 🔧 **Technical Explanation**

### **Why Notifications Don't Work When Closed:**

1. **PWAs run in browser sandbox**
   - Browser controls all permissions
   - Can't run when closed

2. **setTimeout/setInterval limitations**
   - Cleared when app closes
   - Can't schedule future events

3. **Periodic Background Sync**
   - Limited browser support
   - Not exact times
   - Affected by battery optimization

4. **Service Workers**
   - Can show notifications
   - But can't schedule them
   - Need something to trigger them

### **Native Apps Are Different:**

1. **Android AlarmManager**
   - Schedules exact-time alarms
   - Survives app closure
   - Wakes app at scheduled time

2. **Background Services**
   - Run independently of UI
   - Not affected by app state

3. **System Integration**
   - Direct OS notification API
   - Not browser-dependent

---

## ✅ **What Works Reliably (PWA)**

- ✅ Medication tracking
- ✅ History and compliance
- ✅ Blood sugar tracking
- ✅ Reports and diary
- ✅ All data syncs
- ✅ Offline functionality
- ✅ Notifications when app is open

## ❌ **What Doesn't Work Reliably (PWA)**

- ❌ Background notifications when app closed
- ❌ Exact-time alerts if phone is locked and app inactive
- ❌ Notifications after phone restart

---

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### **For Now (Using PWA):**

1. **Install to home screen** - easier access
2. **Open app each morning** - review day's medications
3. **Keep app open** during the day if possible
4. **Set phone alarms** as backup
5. **Check app regularly** - don't rely solely on notifications

### **For Future (Native App):**

1. **Wait for Google Play Store** version (in development)
2. **Same features** + reliable notifications
3. **Data can be backed up** and restored
4. **One-time installation** required
