## [1.1.0] - 2024-10-28

### üéâ Major Improvements

#### ‚úÖ **Fixed Critical Bugs**
- **Custom Medications Integration:** Fixed the major bug where medications added by users weren't showing up on the home screen. Now custom medications from database are properly loaded and displayed.
- **Notifications Scheduling:** Updated to use custom medications from database instead of empty hardcoded array.
- **Removed Hardcoded Personal Data:** Removed specific user names from manifests and descriptions to make the app generic for all users.

#### üÜï **New Features**
- **Welcome Screen:** Added beautiful onboarding experience for first-time users with step-by-step guidance.
- **Error Boundary:** Added error handling to catch and display errors gracefully instead of showing blank screen.
- **Privacy Policy Screen:** Added comprehensive privacy policy page accessible from navigation menu.
- **Sound Generation:** Replaced missing sound files with Web Audio API generated beeps (works reliably on all browsers).

#### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- **Type Safety:** Fixed TypeScript `any` types, added proper type definitions for `BeforeInstallPromptEvent`.
- **No More Page Reloads:** Removed unnecessary `window.location.reload()` calls - app now updates state reactively.
- **Settings Persistence:** Fixed notification settings to actually save and load from database.
- **Real-time Updates:** Added event-based system to update home screen when medications are added/deleted without page reload.

#### üé® **UI/UX Improvements**
- **Removed Stock Tracker Tab:** Hidden the non-functional stock tracker with dummy data (can be re-enabled when implemented).
- **Cleaner Navigation:** Simplified settings tabs to only show functional features.
- **Added Privacy Link:** Easy access to privacy policy from main navigation.

#### üì± **Deployment Ready**
- **Vercel Configuration:** Added `vercel.json` with optimal settings for PWA deployment.
- **Security Headers:** Added security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).
- **Service Worker Caching:** Proper cache headers for service worker.
- **Deployment Guide:** Created comprehensive Vercel deployment guide (`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`).
